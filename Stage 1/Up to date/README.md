# Tutorial: How to use this

## Be advised - currently some errors exist when running on UNIX systems!
We have yet to discover how this problem persists. However, the code generates a flashing and unusable window, when run on MacOS and Ubuntu. 
We are trying to fix these errors, but the code works on Windows. We kindly advise you to see the video instead, if errors persist. 

### How to:
To initiate the TKinter Swarm Production, open the "guinSwarm.py" file. Parts of the other files have been included into this file, which were previously dispersed among the multiple files.

The other files still contain some major elements that are utilized in various areas. To see how the other files work, run "WildBen.py," which will execute the text-based swarm production.

The file "SwarmClass.py" is also used in the second approach, which creates launch files for Gazebo to spawn multiple robots.


A video of the Tkinter approach can be seen on youtube, which is linked below:
